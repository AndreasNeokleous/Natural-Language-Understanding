# Natural Language Understanding

My assignment solutions for [Natural Language Understanding,Generation, and Machine Translation](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/18-19/dpt/cxinfr11157.htm) course at University of Edinburgh [School of Informatics](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk).


# Coursework 1 - Recurrent Neural Networks
* Implemented an RNN model given the mathematical equations. 
* Trained and evaluated the model to learn the agreement rules between subject and predicate in a sentence.

# Coursework 2 - Neural Machine Translation
* Explored the given translation model, which is a bidirectional LSTM with attention, by adding comments and adding more encoder/decoder layers. 
* Augmented  the base code by implementing a lexical model as defined by [Nguyen and Chiang (2017) in section 4](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01329.pdf) 
* Examined the effects of the above modifications on dev-set perplexity, BLEU score, training loss and attention alignments.
